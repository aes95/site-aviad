                <p> I am an audit associate at KPMG who enjoys the fascinating world of code. I entered the world of code by teaching myself Python using the plethora of online resources and the rich online community. I have since begun learning Javascript while continuing to pursue Python (you can never forget that first love).</p>
                  <h3> My Journey</h3>
                  <p> Well, everyone needs a hobby, right?  I have friends in the field and they encouraged me to try it out when I told them that work was slow over the summer. I have always been a problem solver (yes, it is about the nail, and I will gladly pull it out.), and lately work hasnâ€™t been providing enough stimulation so I decided to look for a new challenge and found coding. They suggested that I start with Python, and it was love at first script. Like any good auditor, I started looking for any and all useful information on Python that could be useful. (I ruled out anything immaterial.) It turns out that there is a lot out there, including a wide ranging community of other people who love to code and want to share their knowledge and experiences at all skill levels. 
                  </p>
                  <p>After learning to use Python for a few months, I decided to expand my knowledge into learning Javascript so I could learn some web development. (Can you tell that this is my first website yet?) I spent a lot of time learning to code for fun, finding myself with a new challenge or new problem to solve every day, and I knew I wanted to continue to have that kind of fascination every day so I began to consider a career change into the world of code.
